# Ant Hill Invasion - Changes Log

## 8-bit Style UI Overhaul

### What Changed
- Completely replaced 3D menu system with a 2D pixel-art style interface
- Removed THREE.js dependencies from the menu scene
- Converted the game engine to use 2D Canvas rendering instead of WebGL
- Implemented proper 8-bit style aesthetics throughout the UI
- Added pixel-art ant icon to the menu screen
- Created a more responsive and touch-friendly UI

### Usage Examples
The game now uses a classic 8-bit style menu that can be navigated with a mouse or touch:
```javascript
// Creating a button in the 8-bit style
buttons.push({
    x: (width - buttonWidth) / 2,
    y: height / 2 + 20,
    width: buttonWidth,
    height: buttonHeight, 
    text: 'START GAME',
    action: 'start',
    hovered: false
});
```

### Dependencies
- Added Google Fonts' "Press Start 2P" font for authentic 8-bit text rendering
- Removed THREE.js dependency, reducing the overall bundle size

### Configuration Changes
- Updated style.css with pixelated rendering settings:
```css
image-rendering: pixelated;
image-rendering: crisp-edges;
```

### Known Limitations
- Custom pixel fonts may not render correctly on all mobile devices
- Heavy animations might cause performance issues on older devices

### Future Improvements
- Add support for gamepad/controller input
- Implement more pixel art animations in the menu
- Create a proper sprite-based animation system for game entities
- Add sound effects with 8-bit style audio
