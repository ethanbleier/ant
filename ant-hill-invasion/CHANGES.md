# Ant Hill Invasion - Changes Log

## Complete Migration to 2D Canvas Rendering

### What Changed
- Completely removed THREE.js dependency from the entire codebase
- Converted resource loading system to use 2D canvas-based image loading
- Implemented a more efficient rendering pipeline for 8-bit style graphics
- Reduced bundle size and improved performance by eliminating 3D rendering
- Updated wave system for tower defense gameplay
- Added Map implementation with path finding for enemy movement

### Usage Examples
The game now uses a complete 2D rendering approach:

```javascript
// Drawing game entities with the new system
export function drawImage(ctx, imageName, x, y, width, height) {
    const image = getImage(imageName);
    ctx.drawImage(image, x, y, width, height);
}

// Loading game resources
const imagesToLoad = [
    { name: 'dirt', url: '/images/dirt.png' },
    { name: 'enemy1', url: '/images/enemy1.png' }
];
```

### Dependencies
- Matter.js for 2D physics
- Retained pathfinding library for enemy movement
- using Vite as the build tool

### Configuration Changes
- Updated package.json to remove THREE.js
- Completely replaced 3D resource loading with 2D image loading
- Implemented a canvas-based tile map system

### Known Limitations
- Currently limited to sprite-based rendering without shader effects
- Limited animation capabilities compared to WebGL-based solutions
- Physics calculations may need to be simplified for larger numbers of entities

### Future Improvements
- Implement sprite sheets for more efficient rendering
- Add particle system for effects
- Develop tower upgrade paths
- Create a level editor for custom maps
- Add save/load functionality for game progress

## Tower Defense Mechanics Added

### What Changed
- Implemented a tower defense game where players defend their anthill from invading fire ants
- Created a zigzag path system for enemy ants to follow
- Added a shop interface for purchasing defender ants
- Implemented three types of defender ants: worker, soldier, and sniper
- Added drag-and-drop functionality for placing defenders
- Implemented a wave system with 10 enemy ants per wave
- Added a pause button for setting up defenses
- Created a game economy with currency earned by defeating enemies

### Usage
- Click defender ants in the shop and drag them onto the map (not on the path)
- Press the START button to begin the wave of enemy ants
- Press the pause button or ESC key to pause the game
- Each enemy that reaches your anthill costs you a life
- Defeat all enemies to complete the wave and earn bonus money

### Known Limitations
- Defenders currently don't have visual attack animations
- Collision detection is grid-based rather than pixel-perfect
- Enemies follow a fixed path without pathfinding

### Future Improvements
- Add visual attack animations for defenders
- Implement upgradable defenders
- Add more enemy types with different abilities
- Implement a difficulty progression system for waves
- Add sound effects and background music
